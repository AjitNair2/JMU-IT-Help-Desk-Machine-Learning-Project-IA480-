### Introduction and Project Background
In this project we performed machine learning on JMU IT Help Desk Support Tickets. We used a dataset of tickets that was extracted from the JMU IT Help desk from August 16, 2018 to October 31,2018. The datatype of our dataset is categorical data. The datafields we used from our extracted data are the troubleshooting notes and service grouping. Troubleshooting notes is a brief description of what was done during a IT support session. From the contents of the description a Help Desk Employee choose a service category from the list of existing service categories. Below are examples of what data for these two datafields look like. With our dataset we predicted the service categories for Support tickets in our dataset based off of keywords in the troubleshooting notes section. 

We used the Naive Bayes Machine learning model to form predictions. We did all of our data analysis, machine learning model processing, data testing, data training with the RapidMiner Software. We used Microsoft Excel to visualize our data along with ![Voyant Tools](Voyant-tools.org) to perform some visualization and text analysis.
